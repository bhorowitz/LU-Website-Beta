<h2>Learning Unlimited's Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>

<p>We can be reached via e-mail at info@learningu.org
or you can reach us by telephone at 617-379-0178.</p>

<h3>What personal information do we collection from the people that visit our website or register for supported programs?</h3>

<h3>When do you collect information?</h3>

<p>We collect information from you when you register on our site, subscribe to a newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form or enter information on our site.</p>

<h3>How do we use your information?</h3>

<p>The information we collect through our site registration process is used to support programs and activities conducted by Learning Unlimited ("LU") and its <link to LU Members page>member organizations</link>.  Additionally, it is used to improve these programs and to improve the content of our Web page and to contact users about LU activities and programs run by members of LU.</p>

<p>We may share or publish anonymous information (such as data from surveys) and anonymized aggregate information (such as the number of members on various mailing lists), for any purposes that further LU's mission. We will never share information that could be used to identify a particular person (including their e-mail address, mailing address, or phone number) without their consent.  We will never sell or rent any PII information.</p>

<p>In case of emergency (including but not limited to medical emergencies), we will release all necessary information to any authorities who require it (such as police or medical professionals) as required by state/federal law.</p>

<h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>

<p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>

<p>We do not store credit-card numbers, or any other information that would immediately permit financial transactions, on our servers. All credit card information is processed directly through third party credit card processors who are PCI compliant.</p>

<p>No raw passwords are stored on our servers; all passwords are encrypted using the standard pbkdf2_sha256 algorithm.</p>

<h3>Do we use `cookies'?</h3>

<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>

<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. Note that disabling cookies may affect site functionality and ability to register for programs.</p>


<h3>Opting out</h3>

<p>If you do not want to be contacted by either Learning Unlimited or one of it's member programs in the future, please let us know by sending us e-mail at info@learningu.org and we will immediately remove you from our contact lists.</p>


<h3>Future updates</h3>

<p>From time to time, we may use user information for new, unanticipated uses not yet listed in our privacy notice. We will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes.  If you would like to be contacted directly if this policy changes in the future, please contact us at info@learningu.org.</p>


<h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. -  See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

<p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong> Users can visit our site anonymously.Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above. You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page. You can change your personal information by emailing us or by logging in to your account.</p>

<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>


<h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old; i.e. students in 6th grade and below.</p>

<h3> Fair Information Practices</h3>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>


<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify you via email and via in site notification within 7 business days on knowledge of a data breach which may compromise your information. </p>

<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

<h3>Federal and State Regulation</h3>

<p>Note that this policy is subject to the laws of the United States and the state of Massachusetts where Learning Unlimited is incorporated.</p>
